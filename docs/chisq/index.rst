\Chi Squared Test
=======
A Chi-square test is a statistical test that determines if there is a significant
association between two categorical variables in a sample. It compares the observed
frequencies in each category of a contingency table with the frequencies expected under
the assumption that the variables are independent.

The Chi Squared test is an extension of the crosstab algorithm and does not require
any additional partial functions to be ran. In other words the chi squared test is
computed based on the output of the crosstab algorithm.

See :doc:`/crosstab/index` for more information.
